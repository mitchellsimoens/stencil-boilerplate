# stencil-boilerplate

Boilerplate for StencilJS including support for server-side rendering (SSR).

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to install the npm modules and then run the start script:

    npm install
    npm start

This will run a stenciljs build, start an expressjs server and open the page
in your default browser.
